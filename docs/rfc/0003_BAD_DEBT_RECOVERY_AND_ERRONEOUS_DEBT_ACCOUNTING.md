# Bad Debt Recovery and Erroneous Debt Accounting

---

## Summary

The proposed feature is to allow the following handling of written-off debt:

1. Recover bad debt if Solana validators pay back the debt that the protocol
   wrote off. If a Solana validator expresses his intent of wanting to be
   connected to the DoubleZero network by paying off his bad debt, there is
   currently no way for the network contributors to benefit.
2. Record erroneously calculated debt. There may be unforeseen circumstances
   which result in the accountant to miscalculate debt for a given Solana
   validator. By recording this debt as erroneous, the protocol effectively
   forgives this debt due to its own error.

With the new feature, this debt recovery will provide a windfall to network
contributors for a future rewards distribution.

## Motivation

Currently, there are only two pathways to handle Solana validator debt: pay and
write-off. Paid debt goes towards network contributor rewards. Debt write-offs
help the protocol by relieving the system from accruing bad debt, which reduces
the rewards for a given distribution.

If there were no mechanism to write off bad debt, the protocol will eventually
not be able to distribute rewards as soon as the rewards deferral period ends.
But the protocol does not benefit from keeping this debt written off without any
recourse to recoup these losses.

There are two pathways on how to handle written-off debt.

1. Attempt to collect this debt to recover the losses incurred from the past.
2. Forgive this debt if the protocol accrued this debt by mistake.

The second pathway is effectively no different than keeping the debt written-off
as-is, but it clears up whether a Solana validator is still on the hook to pay.
The first pathway, though, is crucial for rewarding network contributors.

Network contributors may project future revenue based on written-off debt. With
debt recovery, these projections will more accurately reflect the
creditworthiness of users on the network.

Once rewards have been distributed for a given distribution, there is nothing
left to do with that distribution. 2Z tokens swept into those distributions
effectively finalize the amount of rewards that will be distributed to network
contributors and burned. Because the distribution has reached the end of its
lifecycle, recovered debt will act as a windfall for a future distribution. A
future distribution’s swept 2Z amount will be determined by the sum of collected
debt for that distribution and the recovered debt from a past distribution.

## New Terminology

Two new terms are introduced to the protocol: debt recovery and erroneous debt.

Debt recovery defines the mechanism of providing a windfall for a future
distribution based on paying back past bad debt. The term also captures the
ability to improve a Solana validator’s standing in the protocol by showing how
reliable he is paying off his debts.

Erroneous debt is a classification of written-off debt, which can be toggled on
or off. When debt for a given epoch and Solana validator is erroneous, debt will
not be recovered.

## Alternatives Considered

Debt calculations for a given distribution can account for any to-be-recovered
bad debt. This method requires the accountant to know (or guess) the amount a
Solana validator intends to pay back by monitoring this validator’s deposit
account balance. Monitoring Solana validator deposit balances introduces a
significant offchain burden and is prone to error. Even if the Solana validator
were to attach a memo with a particular transfer to his deposit account, the
memo and the deposit balance may not agree because both of these instructions
are independently constructed.

Debt recovery does not have to be implemented at all. If recovery were not
considered, all written-off debt is effectively forgiven, which should not be
the end state of this debt. Solana validator creditworthiness will forever be
tarnished, which is also not an accurate reflection of their ability to pay
their dues.

## Detailed Design

### Onchain

There should be additional fields introduced to the distribution account schema,
which tracks the amount of recovered SOL debt and erroneous merkle leaves.

```rust
pub struct Distribution {
    ..
    /// The amount of SOL that was accrued from a past distribution, but was
    /// written off. This amount is added to the total debt for this
    /// distribution and acts as a windfall for network contributors.
    pub recovered_sol_debt: u64,

    pub erroneous_solana_validator_debt_start_index: u32,
    pub erroneous_solana_validator_debt_end_index: u32,
    ..
}
```

The recovered SOL debt tracking will be modified for the distribution that will
be receiving the windfall. And the distribution who owns the bad debt, the
erroneous bitmap will be modified.

The following method will change to incorporate this recovered SOL debt.

```rust
    pub fn checked_total_sol_debt(&self) -> Option<u64> {
        self.total_solana_validator_debt
            .saturating_add(self.recovered_sol_debt)
            .checked_sub(self.uncollectible_sol_debt)
    }
```

Instead of tracking with the existing `written_off_sol_debt`, where the recovery
process can reduce this value, there should also be another field introduced to
the Solana validator deposit account schema to track the amount of recovered SOL
debt separately. Additionally, a field to track erroneous debt should be added.

```rust
pub struct SolanaValidatorDeposit {
    ..
    /// The amount of SOL that was accrued from a past distribution, but was
    /// written off.
    recovered_sol_debt: u64,
    
    /// The amount of SOL that was erroneously calculated by the protocol.
    erroneous_sol_debt: u64,
    ..
}
```

Recoverable debt would then be calculated as:

```rust
    pub fn checked_recoverable_sol_debt(&self) -> Option<u64> {
        self.written_off_sol_debt
            .saturating_sub(self.recovered_sol_debt)
            .checked_sub(self.erroneous_sol_debt)
    }
```

Three instructions should be introduced.

```rust
pub enum RevenueDistributionInstructionData {
    ..
    ReclassifyBadSolanaValidatorDebt {
        amount: u64,
        proof: MerkleProof,
        classify_erroneous: bool,
    },
    RecoverBadSolanaValidatorDebt {
        amount: u64,
        proof: MerkleProof,
    },
    EnableErroneousSolanaValidatorDebt,
    ..
}
```

#### Reclassify Bad Solana Validator Debt

The reclassify-bad-solana-validator-debt instruction toggles the erroneous
classification on written-off debt. When `classify_erroneous` is true, the debt
is marked as erroneous (effectively forgiving it). When false, the debt is
reclassified back to unpaid. This instruction can only be called by the debt
accountant.

#### Recover Bad Solana Validator Debt

The recover-bad-solana-validator-debt instruction transfers SOL from a Solana
validator's deposit account to the journal, recovering previously written-off
debt and providing a windfall for a future distribution. This instruction can
only be called by the debt accountant because he will determine which
distributions to prioritize for debt recovery.

#### Accounts

Both instructions require the following accounts:

1. Program config. The instruction will check whether the program is paused. If
   it is, force the instruction to revert.

2. Debt accountant. This account's key will be checked against the debt
   accountant key encoded in the program config. This account must be a signer,
   which enforces that the debt accountant is calling this instruction.

3. Distribution with bad debt. This account will have the debt write-off bitmap
   to validate whether the Solana validator has debt written off for this
   distribution. The write-off bitmap value must be true or the instruction will
   revert. For the recover instruction, the write-off bitmap's value at this
   Solana validator's index will be set to false by the time the instruction
   succeeds. For the reclassify instruction, the erroneous bitmap's value will
   be set to true if `classify_erroneous` is true and false if
   `classify_erroneous` is false.

   The distribution account must have already had rewards finalized or the
   instruction will revert.

4. Solana validator deposit account. For the recover instruction, the
   `recovered_sol_debt` field increases by the amount of debt recovered. SOL is
   transferred from this account to the journal. For the reclassify instruction,
   when classifying as erroneous, `erroneous_sol_debt` increases by the amount
   of debt; when reclassifying back to unpaid, `erroneous_sol_debt` decreases
   by the amount of debt.

   Its node ID along with the instruction data will be used to construct the
   leaf to compute the merkle root, which will be verified against the debt
   merkle root in the distribution with bad debt. If the roots do not agree, the
   instruction will revert. The instruction should also revert if the debt
   calculated using this deposit account is not at least as much as the amount
   passed into this instruction.

The recover-bad-solana-validator-debt instruction will need these additional
accounts in order to account for the windfall SOL.

5. Journal. This account will receive the SOL from the Solana validator deposit
   account for the recovered debt amount. This SOL transfer is consistent with
   the pay-solana-validator-debt instruction.

6. Distribution for windfall. This account will have its `recovered_sol_debt`
   increase by the amount of debt recovered. This distribution's debt merkle
   root must be finalized and rewards root must not be finalized (otherwise the
   instruction will revert). This distribution does not have to have any debt
   computed for it; recovered debt is additive, so the total collected debt
   would then result in swept 2Z for rewards.

#### Enable Erroneous Solana Validator Debt

The enable-erroneous-solana-validator-debt instruction will work similarly to
how the enable-solana-validator-debt-write-off. It will reallocate data to the
distribution account based on the number of Solana validators who have debt.
This instruction can be permissionless. The new instruction will check if the
erroneous debt indices have been set yet. If not, set them and reallocate the
account.

### Offchain

The debt accountant offchain process should introduce a programmatic way of
trying to recover debt. For every new epoch, it should attempt to recover debt
from the earliest distribution with written-off debt. The easiest way to
determine whether the process should recover debt is by fetching the Solana
validator deposit balances for all node IDs who have debt calculated and
checking whether the balance of each exceeds the calculated debt for a given
epoch. This debt recovery will apply to the next distribution whose rewards will
be distributed at the turn of the next epoch.

The debt accountant should also add a command to specify erroneous debt
attributed to a Solana validator’s node ID. This command simply invokes the
configure-solana-validator-deposit instruction while specifying an amount for
erroneous SOL debt.

## Impact

Because the proposal adds instructions handling written-off debt only, these
instructions are isolated from the existing Revenue Distribution smart contract
functionality. The offchain changes required to handle debt recovery should
precede a smart contract upgrade, which will support the new instructions.

The debt accountant offchain process will require more logic when it runs. The
programmatic debt recovery can occur immediately after initializing a new
distribution to ensure it runs once per epoch. Or it can be implemented more
simply by running asynchronously by trying to recover debt at a fixed interval
(but this method will require more cycles to run).

There should be no impact to offchain performance.

This change will increase the expected value of rewards for network contributors
by providing a windfall of 2Z tokens as a result of recovering bad debt. And the
community can use the written-off, recovered and erroneous debt amounts to
determine creditworthiness of Solana validators.

## Security Considerations

This change does not introduce new attack surfaces. Both instructions are
guarded by checking that the caller is the debt accountant.

The erroneous debt amount may reveal bugs in tracking Solana validator users,
either in the debt accounting process or at the DoubleZero network layer.

## Backward Compatibility

Everything is backwards compatible because no existing interfaces change. The
existing debt accountant offchain process can continue running while the debt
recovery logic is added.

This change only requires a minor version bump if a major version is established
or a patch version bump if zero-versioned.

## Open Questions

- Can debt recovery be introduced as a permissionless instruction? How can the
  Revenue Distribution program ensure that a recover-bad-solana-validator-debt
  instruction is called at the right time if anyone can call it?
- Should debt be allowed to be classified as erroneous before it was written
  off? There is nothing precluding the accountant from writing off debt and then
  setting as erroneous. But there may be an advantage to having this toggle
  apply to either written off or unprocessed debt.
