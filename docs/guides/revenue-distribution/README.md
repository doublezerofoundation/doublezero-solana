# Revenue Distribution Program

The Revenue Distribution program is a smart contract that channels revenue from
DoubleZero users to network contributors. Like any smart contract, it functions
as a state machineâ€”here, one that manages accounting to enforce the 2Z
tokenomics.

Rewards to contributors are not distributed continuously but at discrete
intervals, aligned with the start of new epochs on the DoubleZero Ledger
(approximately every 48 hours). At each epoch, the system calculates both the
debt owed and the performance of network contributors.

the core mechanism of this smart contract:
